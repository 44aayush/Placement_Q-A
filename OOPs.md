1. **Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)** - <br>
    A programming paradigm that involves designing programs around concepts represented as "objects".
   
2. **Class** - 
    * A collection of functions and attributes, attached to a specific name, which represents abstract concepts.
    * Viewed as factory or template for generating new concepts.
    * Argument (self) refers to the object itself.
    * ***Class Variable*** - variable shared by all instances of the class.
    * ***Instance Variable*** - variable defined inside a method and belong to current instance of the class.
    * * Change to class attribute affects all instances whereas for instance attribute affects only the associated instance.
   
3. **Attribute** - <br>
    A named piece of data
    
4. **Object** - <br>
    * Single concrete instance generated from a class.
    * Comprises of both data members and methods.
     
5. **Inheritance** - <br>
    Transfer of the characteristics of a class to the other classes that are derived from it.
  
6. **__init__()** - <br>
    * When an instance of class is created, the class constructor function is automatically called.
    * Contains code for initialization of new instance with special initial state.
  
7. **Polymorphism** - <br>
    * The ability of message to be displayed in more than one form.
    * * Overloading (Function and Operator) - Compile time Polymorphism
    * * Overriding - Run time Polymorphism
  
8. **Overriding** - <br>
    * Redefinition of base class function in its derived class, with same return type and same parameters
      
9. **Abstract Class** - <br>
    * Blueprint for related classes, accessed only via inheritance.
    * Methods without implementation.
